# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard | Excel, Power Query

## Brief One Line Summary
Interactive Excel dashboard to analyze road accident patterns, severity, and casualty trends.

## Overview
Analyzed 330000+ road accident records to study casualty patterns and accident severity. Built an interactive Excel dashboard to explore trends across multiple dimensions.

## Problem Statement
Understanding road accident trends and severity is important for safety planning and preventive measures. This project identifies patterns in accident frequency, vehicle types, and casualty rates.

## Dataset
Publicly available road accident dataset 


## Dataset Note
**The raw dataset used in this project exceeds GitHub’s file size limit and therefore could not be uploaded to this repository.**


## Tools and Technologies
Excel | Power Query | Pivot Tables | Charts | Slicers

## Methods
- Basic data cleaning and preparation using Power Query  
- Creation of pivot tables and charts for key accident metrics  
- Interactive dashboard with slicers to explore trends across time, vehicle type, and severity  

## Key Insights
- Cars were the leading vehicle type involved in accidents, contributing to 350,000+ casualties  
- Accident frequency was higher during daytime compared to night-time  
- Insights highlight high-risk periods and patterns for road safety planning  

## Dashboard / Output
Interactive Excel dashboard with:
- 5+ pivot tables and 4+ pivot charts  
- 3 slicers for multi-dimensional exploration  
- Visualizations of accident frequency, severity, and casualty patterns

## How to Run this Project:
1. Open the Excel file (.xlsx)
2. Click on **“Enable Editing”** to view and interact with the dashboard 
3. Use slicers for accident date, wind conditions, and weather conditions to filter the data
4. Explore the pivot tables and charts to analyze accident 

## Results & Conclusion
- Clear understanding of accident patterns and high-risk periods  
- Insights can support safety planning and preventive strategies  
- Dashboard provides actionable visualization of casualty trends  

## Future Work
- Integrate predictive modeling to forecast accident hotspots  
- Include regional or location-wise analysis  
- Enhance dashboard with advanced visualizations and Power Query transformations
